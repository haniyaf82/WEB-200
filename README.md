# WEB-200

This repository will contain my work for the WEB 200 - Web Scripting Foundations course. I am taking this course to build a solid foundation in JavaScript, which is essential for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. I am excited to learn how JavaScript works and how it can be used to enhance user experiences on websites.

I plan to use the skills gained from this course to explore web development further, work on personal projects, and eventually grow my knowledge in creating modern, responsive, and engaging websites.
